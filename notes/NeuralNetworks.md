# Neural Networks

In general Neural Networks might be difficult to understand due to their complex structure but there are a few tricks in order to get ahold of what is going on within the black box

## Example

Consider the following scenario: we test the efficacy of a medicinal on serveral indiviudals based on the amount we give them (low medium high) and we observe the following distribution

fitting a strainght line to the data to make prediction will not work, but with a NN we can fit something more effective. and even in the case of more complicated data the NN can be really effective.
