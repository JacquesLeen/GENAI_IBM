    "\n",
    "* [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/) or natural language toolkit, will be employed for data management tasks. It offers comprehensive tools and resources for processing natural language text, making it a valuable choice for tasks such as text preprocessing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/) is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing in Python. spaCy is renowned for its speed and accuracy in processing large volumes of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`BertTokenizer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#berttokenizer) is part of the Hugging Face Transformers library, a popular library for working with state-of-the-art pre-trained language models. BertTokenizer is specifically designed for tokenizing text according to the BERT model's specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`XLNetTokenizer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#xlnettokenizer) is another component of the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is tailored for tokenizing text in alignment with the XLNet model's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`torchtext`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html) It is part of the PyTorch ecosystem, to handle various natural language processing tasks. It  simplifies the process of working with text data and provides functionalities for data preprocessing, tokenization, vocabulary management, and batching."

    "\n",
    "The subword-based tokenizer allows frequently used words to remain unsplit while breaking down infrequent words into meaningful subwords. Techniques such as SentencePiece, or WordPiece are commonly used for subword tokenization. These methods learn subword units from a given text corpus, identifying common prefixes, suffixes, and root words as subword tokens based on their frequency of occurrence. This approach offers the advantage of representing a broader range of words and adapting to the specific language patterns within a text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples below, words are split into subwords, which helps preserve the semantic information associated with the overall word. For instance, 'Unhappiness' is split into 'un' and 'happiness,' both of which can appear as stand-alone subwords. When we combine these individual subwords, they form 'unhappiness,' which retains its meaningful context. This approach aids in maintaining the overall information and semantic meaning of words.\n",

    "SentencePiece is a tool that takes text, divides it into smaller, more manageable parts, assigns IDs to these segments, and ensures that it does so consistently. Consequently, if you use SentencePiece on the same text repeatedly, you will consistently obtain the same subwords and IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unigram and SentencePiece work together by implementing Unigram's subword tokenization method within the SentencePiece framework. SentencePiece handles subword segmentation and ID assignment, while Unigram's principles guide the vocabulary reduction process to create a more efficient representation of the text data. This combination is particularly valuable for various NLP tasks in which subword tokenization can enhance the performance of language models.\n"
